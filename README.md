# Intelligent-Gesture-Based-Security-System
Final Year Project - Developed Intelligent Gesture Based Security System

## Introduction to Work Done (Overview, Applications and Features):
The idea is to design an intelligent pattern lock security system which can be unlocked by simply means of a stored hand gesture pattern. In simple words, it describes a hand gesture based pattern lock security system as simple as opening the door of the house based on the hand gesture. The idea is to create a box like assembly, in which the user places his hand, makes a defined gesture and unlocks the system. Basically, there is a mechanism that allows the user to save a gesture pattern. Once that is done, the system goes in lock state. When the user enters his hand in the box, he tries to recreate the same pattern. If he is able to do so, the system unlocks. If unable to, the system remains locked.

The idea is inspired by the popular mobile phone unlock feature where we basically draw a pattern on the screen and the phone unlocks. I would like to create a similar system which could be used in any security applications mostly in homes, offices, hospitals etc. to make it smart and intelligent as simple as opening the door of the house based on the hand gesture. 

The attractive feature of the project is that the user makes the pattern in the air and not on any surface. Also, I have given the user the flexibility of changing the pattern whenever he wishes to do so. In addition to it, I have also given the feature to see the real time pattern in terms of glowing of respective LED which the user makes in the air on the grids which were made on the screen of the assembly like box.

## Objective of the project:
*The main objective of the project is to design an intelligent pattern lock security system which can be unlocked by means of a stored gesture pattern by comparing the previously stored pattern with the pattern that stored during recreation and if the values matches among both, then the **GREEN LED** will glow which clearly indicates ‘**ACCESS GRANTED**’ otherwise **RED LED** will glow which simply indicates ‘**ACCESS DENIED**’. Basically, the idea is to create a box like assembly, in which the user places his hand or an obstacle such as duster and makes a defined hand gesture pattern and unlocks the system. 

## Technologies Involved:
The software used in the project were AVR Studio 4 in which the programming was done and Proteus 7 Professional designed by Labcenter Electronics in which simulation section of the project was done. In addition to it, SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Communication between PC and microcontroller.

## Detailed Methodology:
There is a mechanism that allows the user to save a gesture pattern. Once that is done, the system goes in lock state. When the user enters his hand in the box, he tries to recreate the same pattern. If he is able to do so, the system unlocks. If unable to, the system remains locked.

## Prototype: Hardware & Software Section:

### Hardware Section:

The hardware section of the proposed idea deals with the components which were used to design the intelligent pattern lock security system. The most significant hardware that I used are the four **Infrared Proximity Sensors-Sharp (GP2Y0A21YK)**. Each sensors requires an external supply of 5 Volts. These sensors detects the hand movements in the space and hence the pattern generated by the user. The sensors are able to detect any obstacle within a range of 10 to 80 cm. I use this property of the sensors and try to scan and store the pattern (i.e. the ADC values) generated by the duster that acts as an obstacle. The output of the sensors is an analog output voltage. The output voltage obtained is 0 volts for the obstacle very near to the sensor and 2.56 Volts for the maximum distance. The analog output is fed to the internal ADC of the microcontroller that will map the corresponding analog readings to the equivalent digital output. 
The hardware circuitry also consists of four switches, 4 push button and a toggle switch.  The main function of each of the push button can be described in such a manner so that the user would be able to understand the concepts which was used in the project. 
In the first stage, first push button acts as a ‘**Scanning Mode**’, whenever the user makes a pattern while pressing a push button switch, then the ADC (Analog-Digital Conversion) starts and when I release the same switch then it will starts scanning the values coming out from the pattern that a user makes at a particular instant. In simple words, this switch is used to accept the pattern from the user when pressed. And in the second stage, when the user presses the second switch, then it simply indicates the ‘**Storing Mode**’. In this mode, the circuit accepts the pattern from the user and stores it for further comparison. In the third stage, while pressing the third switch, it will perform the similar action which has been done in the scanning mode for the ‘Recreation Mode’. In the recreation mode, the user simply makes the similar pattern which was drawn in the first stage and storing the similar pattern as a recreation complete. In the last stage which acts as a '**Compare Mode**', the user checks the recreated pattern with the earlier stored pattern and if the pattern matches, it will indicate that the password is correct and the lock will open which implies “**MATCH FOUND-ACCESS GRANTED**” else “**MATCH NOT FOUND-ACCESS DENIED**”. To indicate the match, I connect the GREEN and RED LED to the controller that glows if the pattern matches or not. The sensors are connected to pins A0, A1, A2 and A3 pins of the ATmega32 microcontroller. The push button is connected pin B0, B1, B2 and B3 and the toggle switch which is used to on/off the power supply of the project. The indicator LED's are connected to pins D6 and D7 of the ATmega32 microcontroller. Each and every stage is shown in the module section of the implementation of the project.

### Software Section:

The software section of the proposed idea is very important because comparing and verification of the pattern is done in the software. The level of security of the system lies in the software. There are mainly three types of actions to be performed by the software: ADC conversion from the proximity sensors, mode selection and gesture activation using switches, input reading, pattern comparing and matching which are shown in the flowchart for the lock and unlock process.
